Built around ESP32 control, motor drivers, and custom mechanical design.', details:[
  'The droid brings together DC gearmotors, a stepper-driven dome, motor drivers, battery power distribution, and 3D-printed parts designed in Onshape.',
  'The custom controller uses two joysticks, six buttons, an ESP32, and an nRF24L01+ PA/LNA radio. A custom KiCad PCB and printed enclosure bring the controls into a Rebel Alliance-shaped design.',
  'An early drivetrain iteration exposed the limits of undersized motors. Scaling and redesigning the robot became an important lesson in motor sizing, torque, and integrating mechanical and electrical systems.'

Designed around electromagnetic geometry, mechanical fit, and manufacturability.',details:[
  'The dual-rotor, single-stator design uses nine coils and twelve magnets on each rotor.',
  'Design work covered coil geometry, magnet sizing, air gaps, bearings, shaft design, and manufacturing tolerances.',
  'Onshape and Fusion 360 supported rotor and stator CAD, with Fusion 360 finite element analysis used to investigate mechanical stress.'

An LCD interface provides rate and compression-volume controls.',details:[
  'Designed and fabricated a 3D-printable mechanism to automate AMBU-bag compression using a brushed DC gearmotor and linkage.',
  'An ESP32 runs the embedded control, while an LCD interface allows adjustment of respiratory rate and compression volume through PWM motor control.',
  'The project combines mechanical CAD, fabrication, electronics, and C++ firmware in a budget-focused engineering prototype.'

 {id:'risc-v-core',name:'32-bit RISC-V Core',tags:['Chip Design','SystemVerilog','RTL'],technologies:['SystemVerilog','RISC-V','Xcelium'],description:'A 32-bit processor core written in SystemVerilog through Georgia Tech’s SiliconJackets onboarding. Implements a subset of RISC-V instructions, connecting instruction decode, an ALU, a register file, and memory interfaces.',details:[
  'Designed the processor RTL in SystemVerilog, including instruction decoding, the register file, arithmetic and logic operations, program-counter control, and memory interfaces.',
  'The core supports a subset of RISC-V functionality spanning arithmetic, shifts, loads, stores, and branches. Design work also explores stalls, memory handshakes, and control timing.',
  'Developed as part of SiliconJackets, Georgia Tech’s student chip-design organization. The RTL design phase is complete, with verification work in progress using SystemVerilog testbenches and Cadence Xcelium. Physical design is a later onboarding stage.'
